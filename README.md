# Group Plan

### Vince: Landing Page

Vince will work on the landing page of the website which will try to set the vibe, theme, and colors of our website. The page will show our group’s logo, company name, background image/s that represents our company, a company slogan, supplementary text, a button to link to the about us page, and social media links. I plan to finish each component (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) within the next 3 weeks. At week 12, I intend to do the HTML component of the landing page. An indicator of a successful week 12 would be a finalized slogan, supplementary texts, set of final images, and VTACK social media pages created. Week 13 will be focused on design which is the CSS and JavaScript portion of the landing page. Week 13 will be successful if I have created an “attractive” landing webpage with final colors, font style, and font size. If there is additional time, I plan to include a timed sliding background for the landing page image since I think I would complement the VTACK website the best.

### Tim: Navbar

Tim will work on the Navbar element. It will remain persistent as the top of the page throughout as you scroll through the website. Navigation buttons to all the other pages on the website (About Us, Our Team, Projects, Contact Us, Pricing) in the Navbar will “skip” to each section (page) when clicked on using a smooth scrolling effect using JavaScript/jQuery. Navbar elements will be edited to follow the website theme. The Navbar will also be made to resize into a vertical sidebar menu for use on smaller screens. The HTML portion of will be complete completed by the end of week 12. The CSS and JavaScript portions will be completed by the end of Week 13.

### Colin: About Us

Colin will work on customization and content for the “About Us” page. First, the template HTML and CSS will be modified to present the “About Us” content in an attractive manner consistent with the website's theme. Next, the Content will be generated to support the section and display to a potential client, what services VTACK could provide to a potential customer. Each service will be accompanied by a themed image to visualize the service being provided. HTML and CSS components will be completed by the end of week 12, with supplementary content and Java Script enhancements completed by Week 13.

### Kendyll: Our Team

Kendyll will work on the "Our Team" page of the website. This page will outline each group member, and the roles they play within our made-up consulting company, "VTACK". Images of each group member will be present in this section, accompanied by a small description for each group member focused on their skills, past work, and what their main role is within the company. JavaScript will be utilized to make each group members description turn into their contact information when the user clicks on the "Contact" button. The HTML code for this portion of the website will be completed by Sunday, November 26th (end of week 12). The CSS for this portion of the website will be completed by Friday, December 3rd (end of week 13). The JavaScript element of this section will be completed by Friday, December 3rd (end of week 13). This will allow ample time before the project is due (week 14) to tie any loose ends or fix any potential errors with the "Our Team" section. 

### ~~Ali~~: Projects 

*Note: Ali has left the program and we have decide to just distribute this part equally*

~~Ali~~ will work on the ‘Projects’ page. The ‘Projects’ page will disclose major projects for a wide range of environmental services completed by VTACK. The projects page will consist of different tabs (ESA, Risk assessment, Hydrogeology, etc.) Each tab will represent a service provided by VTACK and will open a new page. Each page will contain a written and visual description of each project. The pages will be powered by HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This portion of the project will be completed by week 13.
